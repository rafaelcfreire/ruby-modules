## What are Modules

## This Project
This project is for newcomers to [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) language who are striving to get some of their concepts. It introduces one important feature called [modules](http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/html/tut_modules.html) and the mixins idea. It contains a simple module with some example methods that we are going to use in distinct places to demonstrate modules in practice

## Running our Modules in Terminal
- Start the Ruby [REPL](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/irb/rdoc/IRB.html) typing irb
- Type $LOAD_PATH << '.'; to load the necessary modules
- Just type the name of the module (GenericUtils in our case) then '.' and the name of the method you're looking for
